# Feature List


# Environments Used in Testing




Write a readme.txt or readme.md file that describes the contents of your electronic submission. Include the project title and names of all team members. Identify the packages and major source code files. Include a URL to your Github private repo. Describe where/how your log is kept. Provide an overview of the major implemented features and where to find them in the GUI.  
In the readme, clearly describe which Android systems your app was tested on, including emulator and hardware. Describe exactly the environment(s) used, to ensure the markers can replicate an environment and avoid unexpected results. Remember that regardless of the hardware, it must run on the emulator with system image 6.0 (Marshmallow, API level 23).  
Sketch out the overall architecture of your system broadly. Include a copy of the sketch with your submission. You can either draw it on paper and include a scan (or a very readable photo), or draw in software using a tablet or drawing tools. Submit it as a png, jpg, or pdf.  
The developer log will contain entries that belong to the entire team, and those made by individual team members. It will contain information about the entire project, such as developer tasks and their assignments, and records of team meetings and participation. It will also contain individual entries by team members of their work sessions, detailing the amount of time actually spent on tasks. Note that while these log entries may correspond to events in the version control history, the log will still be kept separately from that record.  
It will also describe outstanding bugs and their fixes, and design decisions and rationale. You may choose to use a tool for keeping your log, or a document in the version control system, or a separate shared document (like a Google doc). Whichever tool you choose, you must export it to a text file log.txt and submit it as part of your iteration.
